            <h3><strong>END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT</strong></h3>
            <br>

            <p>
                PLEASE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS PRODUCT: This End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between (a) you (either an individual or a business entity) and (b) Nile Delivery, LLC, a Texas limited liability company ("Company") that governs your use of the Companyâ€™s software product and application ("Company Product"). Other software provided by third parties and used with the Company Product may be subject to a separate EULA. The term "Software Product" means computer software and may include associated media, printed materials and "online" or electronic documentation. An amendment or addendum to this EULA may accompany the Company Product. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Company is a software developer with a technical solution providing an on-call delivery application for businesses.  Through the application, customers will be able to place on-demand requests for a business need, and drivers, who are independent contractors, will be able to fulfill that business need.  Business needs include, but are not limited to, raw material acquisition, courier services, and deliveries.  Drivers are independent contractors, they are not employees, and therefore do not represent the Company. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When you submit a request for a business need, the Company Product will notify a nearby Driver and will provide certain information about you, including your phone number and address, to the Driver in order to enable the Driver to fulfill your request with the utmost accuracy. The Driver will then proceed to take the necessary steps to fulfill your request, including placing an order for requested materials, or traveling to a location to collect/deliver materials for transport.  The Driver may communicate with you during the course of fulfillment, regarding the status of your request, or if any complications arise. The Driver is responsible for request fulfillment.  In the event of a return/exchange of Driver purchased materials, or a receiving party is unavailable or denies acceptance of a delivery, fees will be handled by Company policy at the given time of the occurrence.
