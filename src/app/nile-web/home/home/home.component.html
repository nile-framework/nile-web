    Nile Delivery relieves your need to keep salaried, full-time runners on staff. We’re the smart solution for efficiently and affordably acquiring the materials you need. You pay only as, and when, you need our services. Your projects stay on track, saving you not only valuable time, but eliminating the added expense of pulling yourself or an employee off task to pick up urgently needed supplies.
      
    You order directly from our home screen using your computer or mobile device. 
    You’ll be connected to one of our professional drivers who’ll pick up and deliver your supplies, so you can get back to doing what you do best:<br><span class="font-weight-bold">running your business.</span>
