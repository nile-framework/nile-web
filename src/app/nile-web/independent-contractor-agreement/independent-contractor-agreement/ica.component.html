Services to be Performed by Driver


When Client’s customers submit a request for a business need, the software will notify a nearby Driver and will provide certain information about customer, including customer’s phone number and address, to the Driver in order to enable the Driver to fulfill customer’s request with the utmost accuracy. The Driver will then proceed to take the necessary steps to fulfill customer’s request, including placing an order for requested materials, or traveling to a location to collect/deliver materials for transport.  The Driver may communicate with the customer during the course of fulfillment, regarding the status of your request, or if any complications arise. The Driver is responsible for request fulfillment.  In the event of a return/exchange of Driver purchased materials, or a receiving party is unavailable or denies acceptance of a delivery, the procedure will be handled by Client’s policy at the given time of the occurrence.
